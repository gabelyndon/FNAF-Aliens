# FNAF-Aliens
I started writing this game based off one of my favorite python programming books and the book that got me hooked...Python Crash Course by Eric Mathes. My son is a huge FNAF fan so I customed made this game for him. Instead of using Aliens, like the original game, I made it with his favorite FNAF characters. He liked the game for a whole 10 minutes and thought it was ok... This game is not yet complete, I still have more coding to do but it's a decent start.
Run this game from alien_invasion.py
